# Physics Background

Boundary time crystals (BTCs) are non-equilibrium phases that emerge in open
many-body quantum systems due to the interplay of coherent dynamics and
dissipation.

The **spectral localizer** provides a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying
topological structure in non-Hermitian operators such as Liouvillians.
In this project, the spectral localizer is applied in **operator space**
to characterize the structure of Liouvillian eigenmodes associated with
boundary time crystal oscillations.

The methods implemented here allow one to:

- compute spectral localizer indices for Liouvillian superoperators
- visualize topological domains across an emergent chain
- visualize topological islands in the complex frequency plane

# Spectral Localizer for Boundary Time Crystals

The code implements both standard and accelerated methods for evaluating localizer indices and visualizing the resulting topological structure of Liouvillian spectra.

The project provides tools for:

- Constructing **Liouvillian superoperators** for collective spin models (via QuTiP)
- Computing **spectral localizer indices** in operator space
- Visualizing **topological domains in the complex Liouvillian spectrum**
- Performing **efficient parameter sweeps** using fast LDL-based inertia methods

The code was developed to support research on **topological boundary time crystal oscillations** and related phenomena in dissipative quantum many-body systems.
